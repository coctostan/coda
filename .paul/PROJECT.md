# Project: coda-ecosystem

## Description
- v0.7 Brownfield & Context in progress: all 5 brownfield phases shipped (SCAN→SYNTHESIZE→GAP→VALIDATE→ORIENT) — 567 tests, tsc clean
## Core Value
Enabling developers to build durable, maintainable software through disciplined agent-assisted workflows — bridging the gap between vibe coding speed and production-quality outcomes.

## Current State
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Version | 0.7.0 |
| Status | Milestone v0.7 in progress |
| Last Updated | 2026-04-03 |

**Current system summary:**
- Monorepo scaffolded with 5 packages (`core`, `coda`, `muse`, `lens`, `helm`)
- `@coda/core` ships the L1/L2 foundation: markdown data layer, gated state engine, and v0.2 submode/loop primitives
- `@coda/coda` ships tools (9 coda_* tools), modules, FORGE, workflow engine, and Pi integration
- 5 modules active: security, tdd, architecture, quality, knowledge — 12 prompt files across 5 hook points
- Autonomous review/revise and verify/correct loops run deterministically from the supported `coda_advance` trigger path
- Human review gate blocks BUILD until human approval is recorded
- Exhaustion handling pauses automation and routes operators through `/coda back` and `/coda kill`
- 433 tests passing (179 core + 254 coda), TypeScript strict, no `any` types in source, zero external deps in core
- v0.5 Module Completion complete: 4 E2E fixes, 3 new modules, E2E validation with all 5 modules firing

### Active
- [ ] Resolve the temporary `@coda/core` symlink used by jiti during Pi extension loading
- [ ] Decide whether the repo-root `modules.yaml` symlink remains a local workspace fix or becomes a portable bootstrap step
- [ ] Align `docs/v0.1/07-pi-integration.md` with the shipped real-`ExtensionAPI` implementation
- [ ] Refresh the canonical v0.2 CMUX runbook to match the current cmux CLI syntax
### Planned
- Topic-based section retrieval integration into context-builder (Phase 39)
### Out of Scope
- MUSE, LENS, HELM extensions — post-CODA
- Full module prompt/eval ecosystem
- External service integrations

## Target Users
**Primary:** Serious agentic software developers who need their agentic platform to work as a true software development team.

## Constraints
- Strict layered architecture: core ← coda/muse/lens/helm, downward-only imports
- TypeScript strict mode, no `any` types
- `.coda/` write-protected — all modifications through `coda_*` tools
- Module prompts are data, not TypeScript

## Success Metrics
| Metric | Target | Current |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Milestone v0.7 progress | 11 phases | 9 of 11 complete |
| Test suite | Green | 567 passing, 0 failing |
| TypeScript | Clean build | `tsc --noEmit` clean |
| Pi tools | 10 registered | 10/10 ✅ |
| Modules | 5 modules active | security, tdd, architecture, quality, knowledge ✅ |

## Key Decisions
| Decision | Rationale | Date | Status |
|----------|-----------|------|--------|
| Layered artifact model (`PROJECT.md` + `PRD.md`) adopted at init | Keep hot-path context concise while preserving deeper product definition | 2026-03-28 | Active |
| Spec-first development approach | Extensive docs precede implementation to ensure architectural clarity | 2026-03-28 | Active |
| Manual YAML parser in core | Preserve zero-external-dependency core data layer | 2026-03-28 | Active |
| State gates return structured results | Keep lifecycle failures explicit and non-exception-driven | 2026-03-28 | Active |
| Pi integration uses the real `ExtensionAPI` | Match Pi's actual runtime model and avoid drift from custom wrapper types | 2026-03-28 | Active |
| `import.meta.url` + `fileURLToPath` replaces `import.meta.dir` | Maintain compatibility across Bun and Node/jiti extension loading | 2026-03-28 | Active |
| Autonomous-loop submodes are phase-local, not new top-level phases | Preserve linear lifecycle while allowing bounded review/verify cycles | 2026-03-29 | Active |
| Deterministic structural review writes durable revision artifacts | Keep Phase 10 review/revise loop mechanical, auditable, and disk-backed before later human/LLM gates | 2026-03-29 | Active |
| Deterministic verify failures become YAML artifacts and correction tasks | Keep the verify/correct loop mechanical, auditable, and reusable by BUILD without adding dependencies | 2026-03-29 | Active |
| Human review state is persisted in existing plan frontmatter/body artifacts | Add durable human control without introducing new storage or widening Phase 12 scope | 2026-03-29 | Active |
| Exhausted loops preserve artifacts and require explicit human recovery | Keep exhaustion handling auditable and prevent hidden auto-advancement | 2026-03-29 | Active |
| Pi-facing runtime metadata is emitted from workflow-owned phase context | Keep Pi integration thin while exposing canonical phase/submode/task state to the extension surface | 2026-03-29 | Active |
| Successful `coda_advance` into `review`/`verify` is the supported live autonomous trigger | Close the Phase 15 operator-surface gap without widening the command surface or changing core state semantics | 2026-03-30 | Active |
| Optional frontmatter arrays normalized at the `loadTasks()` boundary | Single defense point protects all downstream runners from missing optional fields | 2026-04-01 | Active |
| `coda_report_findings` explicit tool for findings persistence | Agent submits findings via tool call; Pi doesn't expose `after_agent_turn` hook | 2026-03-29 | Active |
| Sticky findings replaced with latest-per-hookPoint semantics | Prevent stale findings from accumulating across phases | 2026-03-29 | Active |
| Write gate fail-closed on malformed state | If state can't be read, block writes rather than allowing unguarded access | 2026-03-29 | Active |
